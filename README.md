# Atomistic Modeling of The Active Site Formation Mechanism and Olefin Metathesis Kinetics for WO<sub>x</sub>SiO<sub>2</sub>

This repository contains computational studies on the active site formation mechanism and olefin metathesis kinetics for tungsten oxide (WO<sub>x</sub>) supported on silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>). The project is divided into three main parts: Activation, Metathesis, and Microkinetic Simulation.

## **Repository Structure**
### 1. Activation
This folder contains studies on the activation mechanisms of WOx/SiO₂ catalysts. The folder is organised by different carbon chain lengths (C<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>4</sub>) activation of the unreduced W(VI) and reduced W(IV) grafted tungsten atom.

#### C<sub>2</sub> Activation
+ Pseudo-Wittig Mechanism: Surface activation of W(VI) to tungsta-alkylidene using C<sub>2</sub>.
+ Surface Reduction: Surface reduction of the W(VI) to W(IV) using C<sub>2</sub>.
  - Vinylic Mechanism: Coordination of vinylic hydrogen of ethene to the tungsten center to facilitate tungsta-alkylidene generation
  - Carbon-Carbon Hydrogen Transfer Mechanism: Direct hydrogen transfer leading to tungsta-alkylidene formation.

#### C<sub>4</sub> Activation
+ Pseudo Wittig Mechanism: Surface activation of W(VI) to tungsta-alkylidene using C<sub>2</sub>.
+ Surface Reduction: Surface reduction of the W(VI) to W(IV) using C<sub>4</sub>.
  + Vinylic Mechanism: Coordination of vinylic hydrogen of C<sub>4</sub> to the tungsten center to facilitate tungsta-alkylidene generation
  + Indirect Allylic Mechanism: Alkylidene formation, exploring allylic intermediates.

### 2. Metathesis
This folder contains data that explores olefin metathesis reaction pathways.
+ A1 Mechanism: C<sub>4</sub> metathesis to C<sub>3</sub>.
+ A2 Mechanism: C<sub>2</sub> metathesis to C<sub>3</sub>.

### 3. Microkinetic Simulation
This folder contains microkienetic simulation done with mkmcxx at temperatures ranging from 593.15–793.15K.
