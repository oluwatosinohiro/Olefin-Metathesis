setting up local basis functions...
WARNING: You did not specify any basis functions in the lobsterin file.
WARNING: Thus I will default to userecommendedbasisfunctions

INFO: There are more PAW bands than local basis functions available.
INFO: To prevent trouble in orthonormalization and Hamiltonian reconstruction
INFO: the PAW bands from 951 and upwards will be ignored.
setting up CO interactions... found 2 interactions.
projecting...
WARNING: Cannot use the tetrahedron method for k-space integration and must fall
WARNING: back to Gaussian smearing which can take significantly longer. Make
WARNING: sure to use the tetrahedron method whenever applicable.

calculating overlaps...
post-processing projection...
abs. charge spilling:   1.46%

NOTE: The spilling is a measure for the relocation, *not* the absence of electrons.
number of electrons recovered by projection: 1258.0000 of 1258

Setting up molecule fragments... found 1 manually defined molecule fragments...
INFO: No errors detected in LCFO definition...
automatically searching point group for molecule SiC
point group of molecule SiC is Cuv
INFO: Some atoms were missing in the LCFO basis you defined.
INFO: In order to avoid problems with matrix handling later, 
INFO: I added each remaining atom as a new fragment.
INFO: This is NOT an error. 
Transforming AO basis to MO basis...
Writing fragment molecular orbitals
INFO: You did not specify a value for the point density
INFO: using the gridDensityForPrinting keyword.
INFO: Therefore, I will use the default value of 0.05.
INFO: You did not specify a value for the point density
INFO: using the gridBufferForPrinting keyword.
INFO: Therefore, I will use the default value of 0.00 Angstroms.
