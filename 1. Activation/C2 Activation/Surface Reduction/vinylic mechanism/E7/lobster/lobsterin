! First, enter the energetic window in eV (relative to the Fermi level):
!
COHPStartEnergy -20
COHPEndEnergy 20
!
! Then, specify which types of valence orbitals to use:
includeOrbitals s p d
! You can also specify the basis functions per element manually, e.g.:
! basisFunctions O 2s 2p
! basisFunctions W 5s 4s 4p ! Sr_sv potential
!
! Now define the pairs for which COHP analysis etc. should be done.
! The atoms are numbered as per order in the PAW-code control file.
! cohpBetween atom 198 atom 264 ! O and W
!
! If you are interested in single orbital COHPs, you can get all the pairs
! like s-s, s-p_x, ..., p_z-p_z. Uncomment this line to switch it on:
!
cohpBetween atom 204 atom 270 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 49 atom 270 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 2 atom 270 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 1 atom 2 orbitalWise
!
! If you want to generate the COHP pairs automatically, use this to include
! all pairs in a given distance range (in Angstrom, not in atomic units):
! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5
! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5 type Ga type Sr
! and in the latter case only between the specified elements
!
! If you want to transfer the LCAO basis set into a molecular- or fragment-
! orbital basis set, you can tell LOBSTER to combine any number of atoms:
! molecule atom 1 atom 2 atom 3 cell 1 0 0
!
molecule atom 204 atom 270
molecule atom 49 atom 270
molecule atom 2 atom 270
molecule atom 1 atom 2
!
! If molecules or fragments are defined, COHP pairs can be generated as
! follows:
! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5 type Ca type CO3
! Note that the type definition of molecules is case sensitive!
! E.g., CO will be interpreted as carbon monoxide, Co as cobalt.
! The order of atoms is arbitrary: E.g., CO3 = COOO = O3C = O2CO; and so on
